        The purpose of this API is to create an interface for drawing to a canvas using Java.
        Currently we offer an implementation for HTML 5 Canvas. If required you may add implementations
        e.g. for a native Canvas API on Android or iOS. You can choose your implementation depending 
        on the availability on your target platform and performance requirements.

        For HTML5:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext2D gc = HTML5Graphics.getOrCreate("canvas");
</code>
        </pre>
        For JavaFX:
        <pre>
<code>
GraphicsContext2D gc = JavaFXGraphics.getOrCreate("canvas");
</code></pre>
